/*!
 @brief The referral code is the magic part tacked on to URLs shared through the SDK that allows us
 to credit a user for inviting others. You do not need to create these yourself.

 @discussion A referral code consists of two parts:
 - @c userId: 8 characters that uniquely identifies the user/app combination.
 - @c shareId: 2+ characters that identifies a given share. This enables us to associate each share
   with a GIF.

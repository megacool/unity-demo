     clicks (detections that has to go through the backend), for those only the @c
     MCLEventReceivedShareOpened event will be emitted. The referral code (if any) from the link is
     accessible through the @c MCLEventDataReferralCode key in the data dictionary.

     @c isFirstSession can be used to detect if this is the first session by this user. This will be
     persisted across re-installs in the Keychain, thus re-installing the app and clicking a link
     will not emit any new events with `isFirstSession` set.
